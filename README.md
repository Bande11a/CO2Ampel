This program was developed by Malte Gehrmann. It is CO2 trafic light powered by an ESP32. It notifys people in the room
when they need to open their windows to let in fresh air by changing an LED from Green to yellow to red.
It will also display the current time and current CO2 value on a 4 digit 7 segment display.

## How to open:

This program was developed using Platformio in VSCode and the folder strucuture should allow you to just open it as a PlatformIO project.
If you are using a diffrent IDE just copy the code out of /src/main.cpp into your IDE of choice.
